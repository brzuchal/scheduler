## A message to Russian üá∑üá∫ people

If you currently live in Russia, please read [this message](./ToRussianPeople.md).

## Purpose

Message Scheduler implements persistent storage for any kind of message objects

Dispatching can happen at exact trigger time or using recurrence rule which
determines a set of times when the execution mechanism trigger the message.
